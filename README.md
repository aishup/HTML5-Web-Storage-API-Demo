# HTML5-Web-Storage-API-Demo
This demonstrates with an simple example localStorage and sessionStorage

• HTML5 web storage
	• HTML5 local Storage - data is stored in local computer and stores around 5MB . It does not get deleted until it is cleared
	• HTML5 session storage - when the window is closed, data is deleted . It remains for that session only
	• HTML5 web database
• Cookies - These are primarily read in Server- Side whereas local storage is primarily for client side(javascript). 
We have to save the data in locastorage, send them to http header using ajax call. 
• Localstorage can be saved without a expiry data but cookies have a expiry date.
